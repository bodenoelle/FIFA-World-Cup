# FIFA-World-Cup

Project completed as part of the requirement for the award of Master Data Analyst at **10alytics**!

In this project, I used Power Query within Power BI to clean and prepare the data before saving and importing into the Power BI desktop where I used Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) within calculation table to visualize the performance of countries that have participated in the last 5 world cups viz; Korea-Japan 2002, Germany 2006,  South Africa 2010, Brasil 2014, and Russia 2018. I was able to identify both the highest scoring and lowest scoring teams within this time frame and I was also able to deduce if the number of appearance of team has a direct influence on the probability of a team winning the tournament.

I also went further to conduct tailored descriptive analytics on the performance of France and Nigeria during these 5 tournaments time frame by using FILTER within the CALCULATE DAX function to independently visualize they fared.
